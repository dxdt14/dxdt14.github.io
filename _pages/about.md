About Me
===

I am Vidhata Jayaraman, a third year undergraduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) pursuing a dual degree
in Computer Engineering and Mathematics. I am currently doing research under the direction of Professor Lav R. Varshney at UIUC in information theory applications to artificial intelligence and some work in quantum information theory. I am very much interested in pursuing a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning theory with a particular interest in Information Theory and Optimization. I also have a passion for music as I played piano for 14 years (up to age 18) and trombone for 9 years (up through grade 12). 


Academic Interests
===

My main research interests lie in Information theory (particularly in its applications to AI/ML), Quantum Information, Convex and Non-Convex Optimization, and Computational Linguistics. My main goals lie in doing information theoretic analysis of artificial intelligence systems and algorithms to analyze their theoretical performance or determine performance bounds. Much of my interests lie more on the theoretical side than on the computational side as evidenced by my Mathematics major and my interests in AI/ML theory. I have recently gained an interest in Quantum Information as well as it is a very theoretically engaging subject that is related to my main interests. I am particularly interested in quantum learning techniques whether that be Quantum Machine Learning (QML) or tomography.
