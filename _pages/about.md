About Me
===

I am Vidhata Jayaraman, a third year undergraduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) pursuing a dual degree
in Computer Engineering and Mathematics. I am currently doing research under the direction of Professor Lav R. Varshney at UIUC in information theory applications to artificial intelligence and some work in quantum information theory. I am very much interested in pursuing a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning theory with a particular interest in Information Theory and Optimization. I also have a passion for music as I played piano for 14 years and trombone for 9 years (both until age 18). 


Academic Interests
===

My main research interests lie in Information theory (particularly in its applications to AI/ML), Quantum Information, Convex and Non-Convex Optimization, and Computational Linguistics. My main goals lie in doing information theoretic analysis of artificial intelligence systems and algorithms to analyze their theoretical performance or determine performance bounds. I have recently gained an interest in Quantum Information as well particularly for  quantum learning techniques whether that be Quantum Machine Learning (QML) or quantum state/process tomography.
