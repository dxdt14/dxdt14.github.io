About Me
===

I am Vidhata Jayaraman, a fourth year undergraduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) pursuing a dual degree
in Computer Engineering and Mathematics. I am currently doing research under Professors [Lav R. Varshney](https://varshney.csl.illinois.edu) and [Rayadurgam Srikant](https://sites.google.com/a/illinois.edu/srikant) at UIUC in machine learning theory (with a particular focus on information theoretic methods). I am also being co-advised by both professors for my senior thesis on "Information-theoretic limits of Knowledge Distillation". I am planning to pursuing a Ph.D. in machine learning theory/statistics. I also have a passion for music as I played piano for 14 years and trombone for 9 years (both until age 18). 


Academic Interests
===

My main research interests lie in Machine Learning Theory, High-Dimensional Statistics, Optimization, Information Theory, and Uncertainty Quantification, and Quantum Information. My main goals lie in doing statistical and geometric analyses on modern high-dimensional systems to explain their behavior, motivate algorithmic improvements, and find ulitmate performance bounds. I am currently doing work on deriving information-theoretic bounds on knowledge distillation particularly in LLMs, analyzing visual processing in VLMs, analyzing the two-stage retrieval process in Transformer models, and will (soon) be doing work on improving federated learning with multimodal data with Argonne National Laboratory and Prof. Varshney.
