About Me
===

I am Vidhata Jayaraman, a fourth year undergraduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) pursuing a dual degree
in Computer Engineering and Mathematics. I am currently doing research under the direction of Professor Lav R. Varshney at UIUC in interpretability and AI theory (with a focus on information theory). I am very much interested in pursuing a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning theory with a particular interest in Information Theory and Geometry/Topology. I also have a passion for music as I played piano for 14 years and trombone for 9 years (both until age 18). 


Academic Interests
===

My main research interests lie in Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence theory with a focus on optimization, Information Theory, Uncertainty Quantification, and Geometry \& Topology. My main goals lie in doing information theoretic analysis of artificial intelligence systems and algorithms to analyze their theoretical performance or determine performance bounds. I am currently doing work on deriving information-theoretic bound on knowledge distillation particularly in LLMs and on vision-language model (VLM) interpretability.
